Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

### Types of Linked List
1. Single Linked List
2. Double Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

### Applications
1. It is used to implement stacks and queues
2. It is used for representations of Trees and Graphs
3. It is used in Dynamic Memory Allocation

### Internal working in Java
1. LinkedList acts as a dynamic array.
2. The elements are not stored in a continuous fashion.
3. LinkedList is implemented using the doubly linked list data structure.
