A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

### Operations
1. Heapify: Construct a heap from array. TC: O(Nlog(N))
2. Insertion: Insert element into heap. TC: O(logN)
3. Deletion: Returning the top element and removing it from heap. TC: O(logN)
4. Peek: Find the top element. TC: O(1)

### Applications
1. Priority queues
2. Heapsort algorithm
3. Memory management
