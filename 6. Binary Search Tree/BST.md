### Introduction:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value and the right child has a value greater than the node’s value. This property is called the BST property and it makes it possible to efficiently search, insert, and delete elements in the tree.

### Operations:
1. Opeations like Insertion, Search, Traversals & Delete is fulfilled in O(h), where h is height of the tree.
2. To reduce the height of BST, self balancing trees like AVL & Red Black Trees are used, which reduces the TC to O(log(n))

### Applications:
1. To mainatin sorted stream of data
2. Binary Search
3. To Implement Priority Queue
4. Used in Database Indexing
