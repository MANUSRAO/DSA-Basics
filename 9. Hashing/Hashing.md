### Java HashMap
1. Constant time for insertion and retrieval.
2. HashMap does not maintain any order neither based on key nor on basis of value.
3. HashMap extends an abstract class AbstractMap which also provides an incomplete implementation of the Map interface.


### Java HashSet
1. Implements Set Interface.
2. Constant time for operations such as Add, Remove, Contains and Size. 
3. The underlying data structure for HashSet is Hashtable.
4. As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
5. Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in the same order. Objects are inserted based on their hash code.
6. NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
